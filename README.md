# ray
A Raytracer written in JS. Naturally, it does not involve using WebGL APIs or any hight level APIs. Individual Pixel manipulation is all there is to the tracer.

#### Find the ray tracer source at [content/js/tracer.js](https://github.com/harshaxnim/ray/blob/main/content/js/tracer.js)

(This is an entire setup, including a flask server and WSGI connection.)
